# Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine

## Objective
Analyze historical Airbnb data to suggest optimal pricing based on location, season, and listing quality.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, fpdf)
- Tableau
- Excel

## Deliverables
- **Airbnb_Dynamic_Pricing_Report.pdf**: Contains insights, model summary, Tableau visual, and sample predictions.
- **Screenshot 2025-05-08 at 13.30.04.png**: Snapshot of the Tableau dashboard used in the report.
- **README.md**: This documentation.

## Data Source
- `AB_NYC_2019.csv`: NYC Airbnb listings dataset with fields like neighborhood, room type, price, number of reviews, availability, and more.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored pricing patterns by borough and room type, seasonal trends, and review frequency.
2. **Modeling**: Built a linear regression model to predict optimal prices using:
   - Neighborhood group
   - Room type
   - Number of reviews per month
   - Availability
   - Month of last review
3. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to display trends and support price recommendations.

## Key Insights
- Manhattan listings yield the highest average prices.
- Summer months (Mayâ€“July) experience peak bookings.
- High-review listings can sustain premium pricing.
- Shared rooms in less popular boroughs (e.g., Staten Island) require competitive pricing.

## Recommendations
- Optimize listing prices by season and location.
- Increase visibility and review frequency to raise pricing potential.
- Use dashboard filters to explore data by borough and room type for custom insights.
