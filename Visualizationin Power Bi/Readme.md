1. What is the importance of data visualization?
Data visualization helps simplify complex data by presenting it in a visual format, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. It supports faster decision-making, enhances communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and provides insights that might be missed in raw data.

2. When do you use a pie chart vs bar chart?
Pie Chart: Best used to show proportional data or percentages that make up a whole, especially when there are only a few categories.

Bar Chart: Ideal for comparing quantities across different categories. It's more effective than pie charts when dealing with multiple categories or large differences in values.

3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?
Use interactive elements (like filters and tooltips) when possible.

Apply color coding to highlight key insights.

Keep the design simple and clean to avoid clutter.

Use storytelling to guide the viewer through the data with clear labels, titles, and takeaways.

Incorporate animation or transitions sparingly to keep users engaged without overwhelming them.

4. What is data storytelling?
Data storytelling is the process of combining data, visuals, and narrative to explain insights in a compelling and easy-to-understand way. It goes beyond charts by providing context, emotion, and a flow, helping stakeholders connect with the data and act on it.

5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?
Always use appropriate scales, especially on axes.

Avoid truncating axes (like starting at a non-zero point) unless justified and clearly marked.

Maintain consistent intervals and proportions.

Label clearly and avoid cherry-picking data.

Choose the right chart type for the data to avoid misinterpretation.

6. What are best practices in dashboard design?
Focus on the audience’s goals and what they need to know.

Use clear, consistent formatting and layout.

Prioritize important KPIs and place them at the top.

Keep navigation intuitive, and group related visuals.

Ensure it is responsive and fast-loading.

Use filters and drill-downs to allow deeper exploration.

7. What tools have you used for visualization?
I’ve worked with several tools including:

Tableau – for creating interactive dashboards and storytelling.

Power BI – for business reporting and real-time dashboards.

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Python) – for static plots during analysis.

Plotly – for interactive and web-based visualizations.

Excel – for quick, simple charts and pivot table visuals.
