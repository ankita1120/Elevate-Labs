Name: Name of the passenger.

Sex: Gender of the passenger (male/female).

Age: Age of the passenger.

SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.

Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.

Ticket: Ticket number.

Fare: Amount paid for the ticket.

Cabin: Cabin number.

Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

Survived: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Example data:


PassengerId	Pclass	Name	Sex	Age	SibSp	Parch	Fare	Embarked	Survived
1	1	Braund, Mr. Owen	male	22	1	0	7.25	S	0
2	1	Cumings, Mrs. John	female	38	1	0	71.2833	C	1
3	3	Heikkinen, Miss. L.	female	26	0	0	7.925	S	1
Analysis & Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: We impute missing values for Age, Fare, and Embarked using mean or mode.

Encode categorical variables: The Sex and Embarked columns are one-hot encoded or label encoded.

Feature engineering: We create new features like FamilySize by combining SibSp and Parch.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the distributions of features like Age, Fare, and survival rates.

Analyze relationships between features (e.g., survival rate by Pclass, Sex, and Age).

3. Model Building:
We use various classification algorithms to predict survival:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

4. Model Evaluation:
We evaluate the models using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

ROC-AUC

Results
After training several machine learning models, we observed the following:

Best Model: Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 83%.

Key Findings:

Passengers in first class (Pclass=1) had a significantly higher survival rate.

Female passengers had a higher survival rate than male passengers.

Age, family size, and embarked port are also important features.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might structure your observations for each visual:

1. Histogram of Age
Observation: The histogram of Age is right-skewed, suggesting a higher concentration of younger participants, with fewer older individuals.

Insight: This indicates that most participants are younger, which could influence the target demographic for a product or service.

2. Boxplot of Fare
Observation: There are significant outliers in Fare, visible in the boxplot, which may indicate unusually high or low fare values.

Insight: These outliers might be due to special circumstances like long trips or high-demand events, which could be important for pricing analysis or anomaly detection.

3. Scatter Plot of Price vs. Sales
Observation: There is a negative correlation between price and sales, as seen in the downward trend of the scatter plot.

Insight: As price increases, the number of sales tends to decrease, indicating that customers are price-sensitive. This could inform pricing strategies.

4. Correlation Heatmap
Observation: There is a strong positive correlation between quantity and sales value, suggesting that more units sold directly contribute to higher sales revenue.

Insight: This relationship is crucial for forecasting and inventory management.

5. Bar Chart of Product Category Distribution
Observation: The bar chart shows that electronics and clothing are the most frequently sold categories, while furniture has fewer sales.

Insight: Categories like electronics and clothing could be prioritized for promotions or stock increases based on their popularity.

ðŸ§¾ 6. Summary of Findings
Key Patterns and Distributions:

The data shows right-skewed distributions in certain categories like age, implying younger participants dominate the dataset.

Fare and product sales have outliers, indicating extreme values worth investigating further.

Important Correlations:

Strong negative correlation between price and sales suggests that lower prices drive higher sales volumes.

Positive correlation between quantity and total sales confirms the expected relationship that selling more units results in higher revenue.

Data Quality Issues:

Missing values in age and fare columns require imputation or removal.

Outliers in fare and sales may indicate the need for data cleaning or further examination.

Potential Insights for Modeling or Decision-Making:

The insights about price sensitivity and product category popularity can guide marketing and sales strategies.

Correlations between sales metrics will be useful in developing sales forecasting models.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of your questions:

1. What is EDA and why is it important?
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the process of analyzing and summarizing datasets to understand their underlying structure, patterns, relationships, and anomalies. It involves using various statistical and graphical methods.

Importance: EDA helps in identifying:

Data quality issues (e.g., missing values, outliers).

Patterns and trends in the data.

Relationships between variables.

Choosing appropriate models and transformations for analysis.

Making informed decisions about feature engineering.

2. Which plots do you use to check correlation?
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap of a correlation matrix is the most common way to visualize correlations between multiple variables.

Pairplot (Seaborn): A pairplot shows pairwise relationships between variables, along with histograms of individual variables, helping to detect linear and non-linear correlations.

Scatter Plots: When you have only two variables, a scatter plot is an excellent way to visually inspect the relationship between them.

3. How do you handle skewed data?
Log Transformation: Apply log transformation to reduce the impact of large values.

Square Root or Cube Root Transformation: Similar to log transformation but for data with smaller skewness.

Box-Cox Transformation: This is a more general method that can stabilize variance and make data more normal.

Winsorizing: Truncating extreme values to a specific percentile range can reduce skewness.

Imputation: For missing values, you can use median imputation for skewed data, as the median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.

4. How to detect multicollinearity?
Correlation Matrix: High correlations (close to 1 or -1) between predictor variables indicate multicollinearity.

VIF (Variance Inflation Factor): If the VIF value of a variable is higher than a threshold (typically 10), it indicates multicollinearity.

Condition Number: A large condition number indicates potential multicollinearity in the dataset.

Tolerance: Low tolerance (less than 0.1) suggests multicollinearity.

5. What are univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses?
Univariate Analysis: Involves analyzing a single variable to summarize and find patterns. This could include methods like histograms, boxplots, and summary statistics (mean, median, mode).

Bivariate Analysis: Focuses on the relationship between two variables. Examples include scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation analysis.

Multivariate Analysis: Examines more than two variables to understand their interactions and relationships. Examples include pairplots, 3D scatter plots, and multiple regression.

6. Difference between heatmap and pairplot?
Heatmap:

Displays a matrix of values in a color-coded format.

Primarily used for visualizing correlation matrices, showing the relationship between multiple variables.

Focuses on the strength of relationships rather than individual variable distributions.

Pairplot:

Shows pairwise relationships between variables.

Includes scatter plots for continuous variables and histograms for each variable along the diagonal.

Useful for detecting correlations, outliers, and trends between multiple variables.

7. How do you summarize your insights?
Key Patterns: Identify main trends in the data (e.g., most sales occur in the winter months, younger customers dominate the dataset).

Key Correlations: Highlight important relationships between variables (e.g., price negatively correlates with sales, indicating price sensitivity).

Data Quality Issues: Address any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies found in the data.

Potential Insights: Provide actionable insights, such as which features might influence the target variable the most or potential business strategies based on findings.

Visualizations: Include relevant plots (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps) to support your findings visually.
